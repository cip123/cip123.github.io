## 208. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)


Implement a trie with insert, search, and startsWith methods.

    Example:

    Trie trie = new Trie();

    trie.insert("apple");
    trie.search("apple");   // returns true
    trie.search("app");     // returns false
    trie.startsWith("app"); // returns true
    trie.insert("app");   
    trie.search("app");     // returns true


*Solution :*

The trie structure is based on the following principle :

We define a TrieNode which has a mapping betweeen it's children and it's corrsponding TrieNode. I made the mistake of thinking that we need to keep the current character in the trienode but that complicates the structure a lot, so we keep just a hashmap. One more thing to consider is to keep track of the end of the word so we know when it is finished.
