### 399. Evaluate Division

Equations are given in the format A / B = k, where A and B are variables represented as strings, and k is a real number (floating point number). Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return -1.0.

    Example:
    Given a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0.
    queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? .
    return [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ].

*Solution 1: Graph DFS* 

This is a graph problem and now we will treat is as such.
Every node will have a set of neigbours.


For example `a` will have `b` with value `2.0`.
`b` will have neighbour `c` with value `3.0`. We can navigate through the array and we keep a product of the edges we have seen so far. If we see something visited we back up. If we reach the end we return null.

Words of advice:

 1. There are two ways of calculating the product, one is complicated passing the product parameter further on and then returning it, which is silly, and the other one is to just multiply the result before returning.
 2. Don't try to cache the invalid results, if we didn't reach a node at a point it might be cause we were looking for another path and we already visited some nodes.

*Solution 2: Union-Find* 

The union find logic is as follows, we have to keep the results grouped.

So for the previous example, `a -> b , b -> c`. We can store it as a map, so we know we will always find `c` using `a`.  In the same time we need to keep the correspondence between them, so we will have a parallel map with the distances.

Then we do the union.

    union(b, a) will result is `b = a`
    union(b, c) will result in `c = b`


Since we know the map follows that structure, `a -> b -> c` we could keep the values in the same order `2.0, 3.0, 1.0`. 

The implementation has some tricky points:

1. First we put all the elements in the map and then second we union them. For some reason this has to be separate steps otherwise the elements won't connect. Union means that we find the root of each string and we then point the root of `string1` to the root of `string2`. The reason we do that is cause if 2 elements are connected we want their whole ierarchy connected. This will result in a tree like structure. One important aspect is that when we do the connect, we need to calculate the distance from the root of s1 to the root of s2.  That is `value * v2 / v1` for the reference  (where `v1` is distance from `s1` to the root and `v2` is distance from `s2` to the root) .

2. After we finalize the union stage, we iterate through the queries and for each one of them we check if they are connected or not.

If they are we compute the distance to the root for each one and we divide `v1/v2`.


*Solution 3: BFS*

We go back to the first implementation but we do a BFS instead of DFS.

We keep a queue, we keep the visited node track and we add all the children in the queue. 

There is one tricky part, how do we make sure that we have the correct path cause there might be deviations, for example we go through a path which turned out to be a dead end.

One useful trick is to keep the paths in the queue instead of the nodes. So if we reached that dead end which has no children, the whole path is abandoned.


*Solution 3* BFS with 2 pointers.

We keep two visited maps where we keep each node with the path that leads to it.

For this particular problem we have a issue where the paths from destination is being kept in reverse order so when we merge them we have to take this into consideration


### Dijkstra Algorithm


Warning: I didn't use hashmaps to simulate a graph since there are a lot to take care of. I used a Node with visited and distance defaulted to false and 0.

We need a priority queue where we store the nodes to be processed. We start with the destination. Then we visit each neighbour marking the distance to the source as current node distance (distance to the source) + child distance to this current node. We only do that for unprocessed children, once we processed it it is unmodifiable.

 We put the unprocessed children in the priority queue and we mark the current node as processed. No matter what we can't get a better distance. We stop when we pop the destination from the queue. 


## 207. Course Schedule

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

*Solution 1: DFS*

We just use a DFS and two sets for keeping track if the node is visited or visiting. 

If a node has been visited we skip it, if it is currenly visiting (in the call stack) we return false.

After we visit all its children we set the node as visited and not visiting. 

*Solution 2: BFS*

This is more interesting, we keep an array with the incoming vertex count. We add all the nodes with zero incoming vertices to the queue adn then we process them one by one. As we process it we decrease the incoming vertices count of all its children with 1 (since we are done with their parent). We return if the number of processed elements is less than numcourses.
