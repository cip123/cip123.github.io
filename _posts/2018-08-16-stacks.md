## 394. Decode String

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times. Note that `k` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].

Examples:

    s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
    s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
    s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

*Solution*

As a rule of thumb, I notices that problems with parenthesis are a good candidate for stacks, where the parens are the bounds between entries. So I would go like that:

        s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".

For the first level we have `3*`, for the second level we have `a + 2*`, for the third level we have a `c`. 

Reached an `]`, resolve the `a + 2 *` last element which is `c`. Current element is now `acc`, we notice another parens we pop one more and we resolve `3 * acc`.

For this particular problem, it is useful to create a structure for each stack element which contains a prefix `a` and a multiplier `2`. 

One tricky thing is to handle the multiplier because it should always have the default value `1`. So we can't rely on it when doing the usual mathematic trick (which works with `0`). Also we should be careful with the inner loop cause it will affect the outer loop when it has more than `1` digit.
```java


while (i < s.length() && Character.isDigit(s.charAt(i))) {
    element.multiplier = 10 * element.multiplier + Character.getNumericValue(s.charAt(i));
    i++;
}
```
An alternate approach would be to store the multiplier as string also, and we use int getter which will ensure the default of 1.
