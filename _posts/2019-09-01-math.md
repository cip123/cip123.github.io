## 166. Fraction to Recurring Decimal


Given two integers representing the numerator and denominator of a fraction, return the fraction in string format.

If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses.

Example 1:

    Input: numerator = 1, denominator = 2
    Output: "0.5"

Example 2:

    Input: numerator = 2, denominator = 1
    Output: "2"

Example 3:

    Input: numerator = 2, denominator = 3
    Output: "0.(6)"

*Solution *
Key points here :
* Careful with the casts to long, even a Math.abs(Integer.MIN_VALUE) won't work, we need to cast to long inside the parens.
* We need to keep track of the position where the repeating remainder starts to happen.

so for example 1/6

we have 0.1

* 10/6 =  1 r 4, we keep track that 10 is at position 2, fraction becomes 0.1
* 40/6 =  6 r 4, we keep track that 40 is at position 3, fraction is 0.16
* 40/6 = 6 r 4, we found 40 at position 3 so we insert the parenthesis 0.1(6)


149. Max Points on a Line

Given n points on a 2D plane, find the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.

*Solution 1*

The key element here is that we don't need
