## 337. House Robber III

he thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

    Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]

        3
       / \
      2   3
       \   \ 
        3   1


*Solution 1* 

This is a little more difficult than it seems.


So at each node we have the option to steal from the node or not to do it it. If we steal from it, we can't steal from any of the children. If we don't steal, then we have the option to do any combination with the children.

Unfortunately I tried it and there were too many combinations, I got a timeout. 

```java

    public int rob(TreeNode root) {
        return Math.max(visit(root, true), visit(root, false));
    }
    
    private int visit(TreeNode root, boolean steal) {

        if (root == null) return 0;

        int leftTrue = visit(root.left, true);
        int leftFalse = visit(root.left, false);
        int rightTrue = visit(root.right, true);
        int rightFalse = visit(root.right, false);


        if (steal) {
            return leftFalse + rightFalse + root.val;
        } else {

            int bothSteal = leftTrue + rightTrue;
            int bothNoSteal = leftFalse + rightFalse;
            int stealLeft = leftTrue + rightFalse;
            int stealRight = leftFalse + rightTrue;

            return Math.max(bothNoSteal, Math.max(bothSteal, Math.max(stealLeft, stealRight)));

        }
    }
    }

```


With this approach I tried to send downstream the command to steal or not. 

*Solution 2*

Other approach would be to send the parent robbed flag. 

```java
    if (root == null) return 0;

    if (parentRobbed) {
        return visit(root.left, false) + visit(root.right, false);
    } else {

        int nodeRobbed = visit(root.left, true) + visit(root.right, true) + root.val;
        int nodeNotRobbed = visit(root.left, false) + visit(root.right, false);

        return Math.max(nodeRobbed, nodeNotRobbed);
    }
```


The tricky thing is to realize that when we start with root we should always use flag false, since the root's parent can't be robbed, as it doesn't exist.

Afterwards, if the parent was robbed, we can't rob any of the children. If it wasn't robbed we can try to rob the current node or to not rob it.


*Solution 3*

Basically there are two approaches here, one with sending parent robbed information and the other one without sending it. 

If we want to make cache somehow the results we are starting from the end,so we can't use the parent information.

We go back to the solution 1, and we realize that instead of visiting the nodes twice, one with steal command and the other one without, we can return 2 results from each call.

```java
    private Result visit(TreeNode root) {

        if (root == null) return new Result();

        Result left = visit(root.left);
        Result right = visit(root.right);
        
        int robbed = left.notRobbed + right.notRobbed + root.val;

        // if we are not stealing from this node
        int bothSteal = left.robbed + right.robbed;
        int bothNoSteal = left.notRobbed + right.notRobbed;
        int stealLeft = left.robbed + right.notRobbed;
        int stealRight = left.notRobbed + right.robbed;

        int notRobbed = Math.max(bothNoSteal, Math.max(bothSteal, Math.max(stealLeft, stealRight)));


        return new Result(robbed, notRobbed);
    }
```
### 114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.


*Solution 1*

I went left and I arranged all the nodes so the left are shifted to the right. I made sure that I reach the bottom of the left subtree and I added the right item at the end.

*Solution 2*


An alternative is to instead of returning the head of the left tree, navigate to its end and the add the right tree, to pass in the head of the right subtree to the left node which will put it to it's right.


         1
        / \
       2   5
      / \   \
     3   4   6

So for the last subtree (2,3,4) we return 4 from the right subtree. Then we pass 4 to 3, and we put it to the right of 3. Then we return 3.

```java
    private TreeNode flatten(TreeNode node, TreeNode prev) {

        if (node == null) return prev;
        prev = flatten(node.right, prev);
        prev = flatten(node.left, prev);
        node.right = prev;
        node.left = null;
        prev = node;
        return prev;
    }
```
